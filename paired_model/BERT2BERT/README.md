# EncoderDecoder Models using either IgBERT or own Heavy/Light Models

This folder contains scripts to train an EncoderDecoder model with or without adapters using either IgBERT from [Exscientia](https://huggingface.co/Exscientia/IgBert) or our own models: The [heavy model](https://github.com/leaBroe/BERT_for_antibody_pairing/tree/master/heavy_model) as encoder and the [light model](https://github.com/leaBroe/BERT_for_antibody_pairing/tree/master/light_model) as decoder.
