# Environments Usage Guide

This guide describes the various environments available and the specific use-cases for each. The necessity for different environments stems from compatibility issues among packages when employed in specific tasks, such as classification or Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). Moreover, each adapterâ€™s version mandates a corresponding version of transformers. Consequently, to ensure optimal functionality and avoid conflicts, a separate environment is dedicated exclusively to adapters.

## Environment Descriptions

### `adapter_env`
**Usage:** Utilize this environment for running scripts that requires adapters. 

### `classification_env`
**Usage:** This environment is configured for classification tasks (using the ProtBERT bfd model). 

### `mlm_env`
**Usage:** Employ this environment for training the RoBERTa Masked Language Model (MLM) from scratch.  

### `nsp_env`
**Usage:** Environment or Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) and MLM fine-tuning with the ProtBERT bfd model. 

### `OAS_paired_env`
**Usage:** This environment was used for data preprocessing and clustering tasks.
